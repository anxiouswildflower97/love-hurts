        <div class = "title"><center><h1>Love Hurts</h1></center></div>

        <div class = "intro"><h3>The one thing that kept coming to mind while reading "Army of Lovers" by K.M. Soehnlein wasn’t memories specific to the pandemic per se, but memories regarding my friendship with AL, whom I met during the pandemic. I fell in love, hard, during this time. When I think of the COVID-19 pandemic, the thing that immediately comes to mind is my first love.</h3></div>

        <div id="q1">Whenever I look back and wonder, why was he the one?, I land on this: he smiled. We were strangers in the same room at a student conference, and I was staring at him, and he caught my stare, and he welcomed it. Had he been blank-faced or scowling or even intensely cruising, I would have shied away, but his smile invited me in. It said, let’s start something. That was all I needed. My strong, gentle, older-brother-savior had arrived.</div>

        <div id="q2">The call wakes me from a deep sleep. My father’s voice: “She’s gone.” The sky is shading from violet night to pale morning blue as we walk toward 14th Street to the lot where Derek has started parking the car he used to keep at Marilyn’s. Voices grow louder and laughter creeps into conversations, a welcome life to the dreary mood but also, for me, the unwelcome sign that life is already moving on.</div>

        <div id="q3">Zack had seemed like my special discovery, but the opposite is true. His appeal is obvious to anyone. He’s one of those hot guys I swore I’d never fall for. I was already telling myself stories about Zack. I still am.</div>
        <center><button onclick="myFunction3()"><img src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/434113/heart.svg" style="width:20px;"></center>

        <div id="q4">We die, they do nothing is not just a chant, it’s the truth behind all those horror stories about people with AIDS lying on gurneys in the corridors of hospitals waiting for rooms, ignored.</div>
        <center><button onclick="myFunction4()"><img src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/434113/heart.svg" style="width:20px;"></center>

        <div id="q5">I sense someone’s eyes on me - and sure enough, there’s Zack across the apartment, looking our way. I offer him a little wave, and he blows me a kiss.</div>
        <center><button onclick="myFunction5()"><img src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/434113/heart.svg" style="width:20px;"></center>

        <div id="q6">We became friends. It seemed unlikely to me. I’d never been friends with anyone who looked like him. But we had more in common that you’d think. He was not a trophy to me. He was someone I loved.</div>
        <center><button onclick="myFunction6()"><img src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/434113/heart.svg" style="width:20px;"></center>

        <div id="q7">But what if you’re consumed by anger about your own state of being? How do you protest that?</div>
        <center><button onclick="myFunction7()"><img src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/434113/heart.svg" style="width:20px;"></center>

        <div id="q8">He says, “You must be so sad,” a simple and obvious sentiment but one I haven’t yet voiced. “It’s okay to let it out,” he says, which is all it takes, and then I’m crying the tears I haven’t yet shed, while he holds me and rocks me in his arms.</div>
