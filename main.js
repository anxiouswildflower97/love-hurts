I was excited about summer break. It was a weird school year. We went remote from November 2020 to March 2021. Then return to hybrid learning. He came up to me and asked me if I was going to the neighborhood pub after work for the end of year staff get together. I didn’t realize that was an event. He said I should come along and join them. I wasn’t really much of a social person, but figured after all the isolation from COVID, it might be a good idea to go out and meet new people. I learned he was going to the West Coast for the summer and he told me to hit him up when he comes back. <br><br> And with that, summer break began. But, it was not a chill summer.";

Do what you want to do, do things that make you happy, because you can die tomorrow. But, once everything is said and done, we go back to worrying, doing things we don’t want to, pushing things we want to do to later as if we have all of eternity.

If we died, it would be better if died in together in our home, in each other’s company. Thankfully, we recovered. However, I was worried about bringing the virus home again. <br><br> That worry carried over as schools reopened for hybrid learning in September 2020. My worries were lessened when I realized we would have 6 students in the classroom opposed to the 32 students we typically have. I was more relieved when schools went remote from November 2020 to March 2021 so that the chances of getting sick and bringing it home declined tremendously. <br><br> However, my worry turned into frustration when I learned that in September 2021, we would be returning to full class sizes of 32 students. We would still be required to wear masks (don’t have to tell me twice). However, we had to arrange the desks to ensure there was a distance of at least a few feet between students. My classroom was small, the most room I could create between desks was a foot. In addition to returning to normal class sizes, we returned to normal curriculum and instruction. My school believed heavily in testing and we went back to giving five assessments, one project, and two quizzes per unit. We completely ignored the fact that students needed time to adjust to returning to school. Students haven’t been with their peers for almost a year and a half. They haven’t taken tests in a traditional manner for a year and a half. They have seen the world turn upside down, and now we expect them to just adjust as we turn in right side up without any scaffolding or support? Schools preached that we would emphasize social-emotional learning and incorporate that into school culture to support students as we return to normal. We didn’t. Instead, we welcomed them with loads of testing, and the pressure to catch-up and not fall behind because we were already so behind.";
